                Caution, you are about to change the event dates.

                As it appears you are only extending the existing period,
                technician assignments will remain unchanged and will still apply.

                However, if you wish to adjust these assignments according to the new dates, after
                confirming your changes, proceed to step 3 to readjust the technician assignments.

            with-critical-impact: |
                Caution, you are about to change the event dates, which will affect the previously assigned technicians.

                The new period for technician assignment after your changes is: {period}.

                Upon confirming the date modification, the assignments will be reviewed to check their applicability to the new period:
                - Assignments that remain fully applicable will be kept as is.
                - Partially applicable assignments will be adjusted to retain only the portions feasible during the new technician assignment period.
                - Assignments that no longer correspond to the new dates will be removed.

                Regardless, be sure to review the final assignments at step 3 after changing the dates.
